# speedrunning_prediction_research

This repository contains the code and other data files used for the research paper "Features that Impact the Rate of World Records in Video Game Speedrunning", and further details on the approach and implementation for the code can be found there.

Running the following code requires the libraries imported below and should work for their most recent releases. The cells in the Data Processing section should be executed sequentially first, but beyond that the prediction models should be mostly independent to their own cell or cells and can be run in any order to fully create and test a prediction model at a time.
